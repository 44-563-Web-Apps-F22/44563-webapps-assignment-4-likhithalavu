    <h4>Iolanthe Act-1</h4>
    <h5>An Arcadian Landscape.  A river runs around the back of the
        stage.  A rustic bridge crosses the river.

    <p>

    
        Tripping hither, tripping thither,
                 Nobody knows why or whither;<br>
                 We must dance and we must sing
                 Round about our fairy ring!<br>
                 We are dainty little fairies,
                 Ever singing, ever dancing;<br>
            We indulge in our vagaries
                 In a fashion most entrancing.<br>
            If you ask the special function
                 Of our never-ceasing motion,
            We reply, without compunction,
                 That we haven't any notion!<br>
                 CHORUS.

                 No, we haven't any notion!
                      Tripping hither, etc.<br>

                       SOLO—LEILA.

            If you ask us how we live,
            Lovers all essentials give—
                 We can ride on lovers' sighs,
                 Warm ourselves in lovers' eyes,
                 Bathe ourselves in lovers' tears,
                 Clothe ourselves with lovers' fears,
                 Arm ourselves with lovers' darts,
                 Hide ourselves in lovers' hearts.
            When you know us, you'll discover
            That we almost live on lover!<br>

                           CHORUS.

                 Yes, we live on lover!
                 Tripping hither, etc.<br>
          (At the end of Chorus, all sigh wearily.)<br>

  CELIA.  Ah, it's all very well, but since our Queen banished
Iolanthe, fairy revels have not been what they were!<br>

  LEILA.  Iolanthe was the life and soul of Fairyland. <br> Why, she
wrote all our songs and arranged all our dances!  We sing her songs
and we trip her measures, but we don't enjoy ourselves!<br>
  FLETA.  To think that five-and-twenty years have elapsed since
she was banished!  What could she have done to have deserved so
terrible a punishment?<br>
  LEILA.  Something awful!  She married a mortal!
  FLETA.  Oh!  Is it injudicious to marry a mortal?<br>
  LEILA.  Injudicious?  It strikes at the root of the whole
fairy system!  By our laws, the fairy who marries a mortal dies!
  CELIA.  But Iolanthe didn't die!
